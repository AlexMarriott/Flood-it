# Flood It

Flood it is a tile based game where the player must match all tiles on the board with the same colour. 

This application was created for my second year application programming unit using Android studio. 

This is a Android based game written in Java.

It makes uses of the of the "Flood Fill" algorithm to fill the select tiles on the board.
