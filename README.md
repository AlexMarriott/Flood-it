# FloodIt

Floodit is a tile-based game where the player must match all tiles on the board with the same colour.

This application was created for my second-year application programming unit using Android studio.

This is an Android-based game written in Java.

It makes uses of the "Flood Fill" algorithm to fill the select tiles on the board.
